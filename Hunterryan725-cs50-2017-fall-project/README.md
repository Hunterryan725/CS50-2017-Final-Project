Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project.
Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable,
to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length.
It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission.
Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.

For my project I created a web application similar to Craigslist, excepted geared toward college campus communities in which the users are not anonymous
and the cities are the schools. To begin using the site, first register under the registration tab in the top right corner. Fill out the information to create
an account - NOTE - a valid Yale email must be used in order to sucessfully register. Upon registration you will be redireced to the login page. To login in
you must enter your email and password in which you signed up as well as enter your access key. Your access key is a 5 digit number that will be emailed to
the yale email in which you used to sign up - thus ensuring that the email used is not just an email that contains the string @yale.edu. Upon signing in you will
be directed to a homepage with a variety of different tables containing forums.

In the header you will see 5 options
1) Home - A button that will return you to the main page with all of the forums listed
2) Post - Directs you to a page where you can create a new thread
3) Profile - Directs you to a page where you can see your personal information as well as change your profile picture
4) My Posts - Directs you to a page that displays all of the threads you created so you can easily access them
5) Logout - Allows you to log out of your account

Upon clicking on a forum below you will be redirected to a page that displays a list of threads created under the forum. From here you have 3 options
1) You can click post and you will be directed to a page that will allow you to create a new page under that forum
2) You can click on the user who posted the thread - In doing so you will be redirected to that users profile page, allowing you to view their information
and even collect their email to reach out to them if they posted something of interest. You additionally can click on a link below on the users page
to access a list of all of the threads they have posted so you can see if they have posted anything else of interest.
3) You can click on one of the threads that grab your attention in which you will be redirected to the page displaying the thread.

After moving to the page displaying the thread you will have two options of action
1) you can again click on the user who posted the thread - In doing so you will be redirected to that users profile page, allowing you to view their information
and even collect their email to reach out to them if they posted something of interest. You additionally can click on a link below on the users page
to access a list of all of the threads they have posted so you can see if they have posted anything else of interest.
2) You can scroll to the bottom of the page and leave a comment on the thread. After clicking the button to comment the page will be refreshed
and your comment will appear
